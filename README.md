# Surfs Up

We are providing potential Surf n' Shake business investor W. Avy with weather analysis from the islands of Hawai'i to identify an ideal shop location.

## Analysis

Below are side-by-side summary statistics for the temperature data collected in June versus the temperature data collected in December. Temperature data is collected in Fahrenheit. It is additionally important to note that Hawai'i is located in the Northern Hemisphere and follows the seasonal patterns associated with the Northern Hemisphere. However, because of its island location, Hawai'i's weather is much more strongly influenced by oceanic trade winds and can be better described as having a summertime "dry season" and a wintertime "rainy season".

![dec summary](https://github.com/cewarkentin/surfs_up/blob/main/dec%20summary.png)

The average temperature across all weather stations in June is 74.9F +-3.3F. The average temperature across all weather stations in December is 71.0F +-3.7F. The average temperatures are both within 1.1 standard deviations of each other, meaning with the data spread we have, they are very similar.

The minimum temperature in June was 64F, and the minimum temperature in December was 56F.

The maximum temperature in June was 85F, and the maximum temperature in December was 83F.

The month of December has a wider range of lower temperatures, and reaches colder temperatures overall, which follows expectations for wintertime weather.

## Results

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.

## Summary

The Surf n' Shake shop is centered around surfboard rentals and ice cream sales. As of right now, our analysis illustrates the temperature and rainfall patterns across all of Hawai'i. For further analysis, it would be helpful to identify if there are differences in weather depending on the station the weather data was collected at--this will help better pinpoint an ideal location for the shop. This can be achieved using a query and the data that we already currently have.

Performing queries to summarize the summertime "dry season" and wintertime "rainy season" may be a better representation of the weather rather than looking specifically at June and December. I am unsure if June and December were chosen randomly or intentionally, but it may be a better representation of the weather to look at the seasons rather than single specific months (i.e. I know that looking at temperatures in December would not accurately represent the coldest of the winter in Texas, nor would looking at temperatures in June represent the hottest of summer). Again, these queries can be achieved using the data that we already currently have.

Additionally, it would be helpful to find data on ideal surfing weather conditions to compare with the weather conditions we have identified. Similarly, it would be helpful to use data from current ice cream parlors to identify ideal locations and weather for ice cream sales. This additional data anlysis would provide important information on whether or not this is a venture worth investing in.
